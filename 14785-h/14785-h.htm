<h2>
    Preface
</h2>
<p>
This play is intended, not only for acting, but also for reading.
It is so arranged that boys and girls can read it to themselves,
just as they would read any other story. Even the stage directions and
the descriptions of scenery are presented as a part of the narrative.
At the same time, by the use of different styles of type, the speeches
of the characters are clearly distinguished from the rest of the text,
an arrangement which will be found convenient when parts are being
memorized for acting.
</p>
<p>
The play has been acted more than once, and by different groups of
people; sometimes on a stage equipped with footlights, curtain, and
scenery; sometimes with barely any of these aids. Practical suggestions
as to costumes, scenery, and some simple scenic effects will be found
at the end of the play.
</p>
<p>
What sort of a Christmas play do the boys and girls like, and in what
sort do we like to see them take part? It should be a play, surely, in
which the dialogue is simple and natural, not stilted and artificial;
one that seems like a bit of real life, and yet has plenty of fancy and
imagination in it; one that suggests and helps to perpetuate some of
the happy and wholesome customs of Christmas; above all, one that is
pervaded by the Christmas spirit. I hope that this play does not
entirely fail to meet these requirements.

    Down the Chimney
</h2>
<h3>
The First Scene
</h3>

<p>
<i>Now the curtain opens, and you see the Roof of a House, just as
Mother Goose promised. Keep your eyes open to see what will happen next,
for here comes</i> JACK FROST, <i>who is dressed all in white. He walks
with a quick and nimble step, and this is what he says</i>:
</p>
<p>
Would you believe from the look of things, that to-morrow is Christmas?
There is not a flake of snow anywhere. This roof is as clear as it is
in summer. These pine trees, whose boughs hang over the roof, are all
green. The chimney has not even an icicle on it. I hear people saying
that we have no old-fashioned winters any more. Even old Mother Cary
said to me the other day, "Jack Frost," said she, "when are you going
to give them a real snow-storm?" But I told her not to be impatient:
I would attend to it all in good time. And when I do begin, it doesn't
take me long to get up a fine old storm, I can tell you. <i>Now he walks
up to the Chimney, and knocks on the side of it</i>. Say, old fellow.
<i>He waits a moment; then knocks again</i>. Wake up there. <i>He waits
a moment; then knocks again</i>. Wake up, I say.
</p>
<p>
<i>And now&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;the Chimney opens, first, one of his
eyes, then the other; and then his mouth and nose appear together. Each
of his eyes is exactly the shape and size of one brick. So is his nose.
And his mouth is as long as two bricks side by side. They all turn a
very bright red, when they appear, as though light were shining through
them.</i>
</p>
<p>
JACK FROST <i>goes on talking</i>: What do you mean, Mr. Chimney, by
going to sleep in winter, I'd like to know? Summer is the time for you
chimneys to go to sleep; but in winter when the people in the houses
have their fires burning, you ought to keep wide awake, so as to carry
off the smoke; don't you know that? Sleepy head! You ought to be ashamed
of yourself.
</p>
<p>
THE CHIMNEY <i>answers</i>: Nothing of the sort. Have you forgotten what
night this is, Jack Frost? Don't you know that this is Christmas Eve,
when the fires are all put out, so that Santa Claus can climb down
without getting burned? That's why I was taking a little nap. See? <i>He
winks with one eye.</i>
</p>
<p>
JACK FROST <i>says</i>: Oh, that's it, is it? Well, that's true enough.
I hadn't thought of old Santa Claus. He'll be here before long,
probably.
</p>
<p>
Yes, too soon, <i>says</i> THE CHIMNEY; for I haven't had my sleep half
out, and here you are, keeping me awake for nothing. With your kind
permission, I'll take another forty winks.
</p>
<p>
<i>And now his eyes close, then his nose and mouth disappear, and in a
moment he is sound asleep again.</i>
</p>
<p>
Lazy old fellow! <i>exclaims</i> JACK FROST. Well, I must get to work if
we are to have a real old-fashioned storm before morning. And first for
some wind. Where are those Wind Fairies, I wonder? They ought to be here
by now. <i>He puts his hands beside his mouth, and calls in a high
voice:</i> Hoo&mdash;oo! Hoo&mdash;oo!
</p>
<p>
THE WIND FAIRIES <i>are heard from far, far away, calling in answer:</i>
Hoo-oo! Hoo-oo!
</p>
<p>
JACK FROST, <i>as soon as he hears them, says joyfully:</i> There they
are. They'll be here in a second.
</p>
<p>
<i>And now you can hear the Wind Fairies coming gradually nearer, making
the wind-noise as the come, like this:</i>

  z&mdash;z&mdash;z z&mdash;z&mdash;z z&mdash;Z&mdash;Z&mdash;Z&mdash;z&mdash;z&mdash;z
</p>
<p>
<i>This grows louder and louder, till suddenly in come the Wind Fairies,
running. They are all in gray; they have on gray peaked caps, gray capes
which comes down to their knees, and long gray stockings; and they have
gray masks over the upper parts of their faces. The Fairies stop short
before Jack Frost, and make him a low bow. Then they sing their song,
which is called</i>

<p>
<i>As soon as the song is over, off run the Wind Fairies, making the
wind-noise as they go, which grows fainter and fainter as they get
further and further away, like this</i>

</p>
<p>
<i>When the sound of the wind has quite died away</i>, THE CHIMNEY
<i>opens one eye, and speaking slowly and sleepily, says:</i> Look here,
Jack, something's going on in my inside. <i>He opens the other eye, and
his nose and mouth appear. He speaks more briskly</i>: It feels as
though there were something hot in there. Do you suppose those stupid
people in the house down below have forgotten all about Santa Claus, and
are lighting the fire on the hearth? I believe they are. I wish you'd
just climb up on my shoulder, and shout down to them to stop. Do:
there's a good fellow.
</p>
<p>
JACK FROST <i>climbs up, puts his head over the chimney, then draws back
coughing</i>. Fire? <i>cries he</i>. I should say there was, and smoke,
too; enough to choke a locomotive. <i>He cautiously peers down</i>.
Hello there, you people, put that fire out. Do you hear? Put it out.
Santa Claus is coming. Do you hear what I say? SANTA CLAUS IS COMING.
Put out that fire.
</p>
<p>
<i>There is a pause; then a hissing sound, loud at first, then dying
away, like this</i>:

<p>
There! <i>says</i> JACK FROST, they've thrown a pitcherful of water on
it. <i>He climbs down from the chimney</i>.
</p>
<p>
THE CHIMNEY, <i>who has now grown sleepy again, says to him, in a voice
that grows fainter and fainter</i>: Thank you, my dear fellow:
you&mdash;real&mdash;ly (<i>Here one eye closes</i>) are&mdash;ver&mdash;y&mdash;ki&mdash;<i>And he
never finishes the sentence, for the other eye closes, and the nose and
mouth "go out" at the same moment.</i>
</p>
<p>
Asleep again, I declare, says JACK FROST, <i>with disgust</i>. Well, now
for the Snow Fairies.
</p>
<p>
<i>He walks to the edge of the roof at one side, and blows a shrill
blast on a whistle. Almost at once snow begins to fall from the sky,
slowly at first, then more and more. Jack Frost looks up at it and nods
his head approvingly. When it is snowing very hard, in come on tip-toe,
very softly, the Snow Fairies, dressed in snowy white, with white hoods
and muffs. Some of them quietly spread snow on the boughs of the trees,
taking it out of their muffs; others hang flakes on the Chimney, in such
a way as to make eyebrows, mustache, and beard for the face. But this
doesn't show at first, because the Chimney is still asleep. Then the
Fairies, standing in front of the Chimney, so that they hide it, sing
their song, which is called</i>

<div class="poem">

<p class="i2">   When children go to bed at night, </p>
<p class="i2">   We fairies come with snow-flakes white; </p>

<p class="i2">   Cosily tucked in our beds of snow. </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
THE CHIMNEY, <i>who is still hidden behind the Snow Fairies, wakes up
while they are singing the last line, and calls out</i>: What's this,
I'd like to know? Who's been decorating my face?
</p>
<p>
<i>The Snow Fairies stand back on either side, so that his face can now
be seen, with its white eyebrows and mustache and beard, all made of
snow-flakes; and he goes on talking in a jolly voice</i>: Oh, you sly
ones, you are at your old tricks. Well, well, I'm really glad to see
you. It seems like old times to have snow at Christmas. Now don't mind
me; go on with your work; cover me up with your snowflakes as much as
you choose&mdash;eyes, nose, mouth, and all; I don't mind it a bit.
</p>
<p>
<i>So the Snow Fairies, moving softly about, hang more snow-flakes on
the chimney, even over his eyes and nose and mouth, which show dimly
through the snow. His eyes blink now and then.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>And now, sleigh-bells are heard in the distance.</i>
</p>
<p>
Hark! <i>cries</i> JACK FROST.
</p>
<p>
<i>They all listen: the bells are still heard, a little nearer.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Then</i> JACK FROST <i>continues</i>: There comes Santa Claus, sure
enough. Let's give the old fellow a surprise. Here! All hide behind the
Chimney.
</p>
<p>
<i>Very quickly, but very quietly, too, they all hide. The sleigh-bells
come nearer and nearer, till they seem to be just outside: then they
stop, and a voice, which plainly belongs to</i> SANTA CLAUS,
<i>says</i>: Whoa! Quiet, Prancer! Blitzen, stand still there!
</p>
<p>
<i>And now Santa Claus himself appears, with his pack of toys. He walks
to the middle of the roof, and sets down the pack.</i>
</p>
<p>
It certainly is getting cold, <i>says</i> SANTA CLAUS <i>to himself. For
he does not see Jack Frost and the Snow Fairies, who are hidden behind
the Chimney. He goes on talking</i>: And what a lot of snow there is
about here. It is really like the Christmas eves we used to have fifty
years ago. My pack seems to be coming undone. <i>He stoops to fix
it.</i> I should hate to have it burst open, while I was going down the
Chimney.
</p>
<p>
<i>Now the Snow Fairies have come out from behind the Chimney, and are
stealing up behind him on tip-toe. When they are quite close, they throw
great handfuls of snow at him. He starts up, surprised, but bursts into
a great laugh</i>:
</p>
<p>
Ho! ho! ho! This is a fine way to treat an old man! <i>says</i> SANTA
CLAUS. Ho! ho! ho! ho! This is fine fun indeed! Hello, Jack Frost, is
that you? And how are you, my little roley-poley snow-balls? White and
light as ever, I see. And you've made me all white too, but not very
light, I fear. Well, well, be off with you, for I must go down the
Chimney.
</p>
<p>
<i>He bows to the Chimney, whose eyes blink through the snow.</i>
</p>
<p>
Good evening, my old friend, <i>says</i> SANTA CLAUS. YOU are enjoying
good health, I hope. May I climb down inside of you as usual?
</p>
<p>
THE CHIMNEY <i>answers, in a muffled voice, because he is so covered up
with snow</i>: Go ahead, Santa, I'm used to it.
</p>
<p>
<i>So Santa Claus climbs to the top of the Chimney, steps over, and
after throwing a kiss to the Snow Fairies, who return it, he goes down
out of sight.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>And that is the end of the First Scene.</i>

<h2>
    THE INTERLUDE
</h2>
<p>
<i>Again, before the Second Scene begins</i>, MOTHER GOOSE <i>comes out
in front of the curtain and this is what she says</i>:
</p>
<p>
Well, my dears, I hope you are enjoying my little Play. And what do you
suppose comes next? Wouldn't you like to see who lives down inside that
house, where the chimney was; and what they were doing while Jack Frost
and the others were up on the roof, and whether they heard the Wind
Fairies; and whether they knew that the Snow Fairies had come; and how
they came to make that mistake, lighting a fire in the fireplace where
Santa Claus had come down? Well, that is just what the next scene is to
be about. Last time we were up on the roof; this time we shall be down
in the Room, in front of the fire-place. So be still and listen
carefully, for now it is going to begin.
</p>
<hr />

<div style="height: 4em;"><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

<h2>
    The Second Scene
</h2>
<p>
<i>When the curtain opens this time, you can see into the Room of the
House, just as Mother Goose promised. Notice that on one side of the
fire-place is a window with curtains drawn, on the other, a washstand
with howl and pitcher. In front, on right and left, are two large beds.
In the middle of the room, with her hack to the fire-place, the
Grandmother is seated on a low chair, and about her in a half-circle on
stools, sit the eight grandchildren, four girls and four boys, all in
their night-clothes and wrappers.</i>
</p>
<p>
ISABEL <i>begins by asking</i>: Grandmother, how old are you?
</p>
<p>
GRANDMOTHER <i>replies</i>: How old do you think, my dear?
</p>
<p>
ISABEL <i>guesses</i>: A hundred?
</p>
<p>
Almost, <i>says</i> GRANDMOTHER: Why, I can remember when all your
mothers and fathers were little boys and girls like you. Your mother,
Margaret and Sally, and your father, Jack and Tom and Helen, and your
father, Isabel, and your mother, Ned and Frank, were my little boys and
girls, you know; and on Christmas Eve I used to sit with them in the
nursery, just as I am sitting with you now. That is why I told them
to go downstairs and leave me alone with you for a little while
tonight&mdash;for the sake of old times. Yes, they used to sit around me
just like this, and then I used to tell them a story.
</p>
<p>
A story! A story! <i>cry</i> ALL THE CHILDREN.
</p>
<p>
<i>And</i> GRANDMOTHER <i>says</i>: Shall I tell you one? <i>The
children all nod</i>. Let me think, <i>says she</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>The Wind Fairies are heard outside, making the wind-noise, like
this</i>:
</p>
<p class="quote">
  z&mdash;z&mdash;z  z&mdash;z&mdash;z  z&mdash;Z&mdash;Z&mdash;Z&mdash;z&mdash;z&mdash;z<br />
  z&mdash;z&mdash;z  z&mdash;z&mdash;z  z&mdash;Z&mdash;Z&mdash;Z&mdash;z&mdash;z&mdash;z
</p>
<p>
GRANDMOTHER <i>listens to them, then begins her story</i>: Well, once
there was a wicked king, who didn't like cold weather; so he sent his
soldiers, and told them to catch all the cold Wind Fairies and&mdash;
</p>
<p>
TOM <i>interrupts her to ask</i>: Are there really Wind Fairies, Grandmother?
</p>
<p>
GRANDMOTHER <i>answers</i>: Of course there are. I think I heard them a
moment ago. Listen!
</p>
<p>
<i>They all listen. The Wind Fairies are heard outside, like this</i>:
</p>
<p class="quote">
  z&mdash;z&mdash;z z&mdash;z&mdash;z z&mdash;Z&mdash;Z&mdash;Z&mdash;z&mdash;z&mdash;z
</p>
<p>
Do you hear them? <i>asks</i> GRANDMOTHER. <i>The children all nod</i>.
Yes, <i>she continues, going on with the story</i>, the king told his
soldiers to catch all the Wind Fairies, and all the Snow Fairies, and
Jack Frost himself, and to lock them all up in prison.
</p>
<p>
And did the soldiers do it? <i>asks</i> HELEN.
</p>
<p>
Yes, <i>answers</i> GRANDMOTHER. They locked up all of them except one
little Wind Fairy, and he was so small and so quick, that they couldn't
catch him; and what do you suppose he did? He rattled the windows so
hard that the king couldn't sleep, and he blew so hard down the chimney
and through the cracks around the doors, that he blew out all the lights
in the king's house, and gave the king such a bad cold in his head,
that&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Here Grandmother herself sneezes. And the Wind Fairies are heard
outside, like this</i>:

<p class="quote">
  z&mdash;z&mdash;z  z&mdash;z&mdash;z  z&mdash;Z&mdash;Z&mdash;Z&mdash;z&mdash;z&mdash;z
</p>
<p>
How the wind does blow tonight, <i>says</i> GRANDMOTHER. Children, it
seems to me very cold in this room. <i>She looks around to see what
makes it so chilly.</i> Why, bless me, <i>she says</i>, they have forgotten
to light the fire. <i>She rises, the children also, and they all go
toward the fire-place.</i> Frank, <i>says</i> GRANDMOTHER, hand me the matches.
<i>He brings them. She stoops at the hearth, the children standing
around, and soon a bright glow appears and is seen to dance about.</i>
There, that will soon make a fine blaze, <i>says she.</i> Hold up your
hands, children, and warm them.
</p>
<p>
<i>But suddenly from up the chimney comes the voice of</i> JACK FROST:
Hello there, you people, put that fire out. <i>Grandmother and the
children are startled.</i> Do you hear? <i>shouts</i> JACK FROST. Put it
out. Santa Claus is coming. Do you hear what I say? SANTA CLAUS IS
COMING. Put out that fire.
</p>
<p>
Why, children, <i>cries</i> GRANDMOTHER, I had forgotten all about that.
Quick! We must indeed put the fire out at once. Ned, bring me that
pitcher of water.
</p>
<p>
<i>He brings it; she throws the water on the fire. The glow disappears
and a great hissing sound is heard, loud at first, then dying away, like
this</i>:
</p>
<p class="quote">
S&mdash;S&mdash;S&mdash;s&mdash;s&mdash;s&mdash;s&mdash;s&mdash;s&mdash;s&mdash;s&mdash;s&mdash;s&mdash;s
</p>
<p>
There! <i>says</i> GRANDMOTHER. It is quite out, you see. And now, you
must hang up your stockings, quickly, and hurry into bed. <i>A shrill
whistle is heard outside</i>. What was that? GRANDMOTHER <i>asks</i>.
</p>
<p>
It sounded like a whistle out of doors, <i>answers</i> MARGARET; <i>and
she goes to the window and looks out.</i> Why, Grandmother, <i>says
she</i>, it's beginning to snow.
</p>
<p>
Good! <i>says</i> GRANDMOTHER. That will make it easier for Santa Claus
to get here in his sleigh. So make haste with your stockings, and then,
before you get into bed, we will read from the Good Book about what
happened on the first Christmas night so many, many years ago.
</p>
<p>
<i>They bring their stockings and hang them in a row over the
fire-place. Meantime Grandmother has taken the big Bible, and seated
herself in the low chair in the middle of the room. The children, when
the stockings are hung, group themselves beside her, standing, looking
over her shoulders, her arms around some of them. Then</i> GRANDMOTHER
<i>reads</i>:
</p>
<p>
And there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field, and
keeping watch by night over their flock. And an angel of the Lord stood
by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were
sore afraid.
</p>
<p>
And the angel said unto them, "Be not afraid; for, behold, I bring you
good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all the people. For there
is born to you this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ
the Lord. And this shall be the sign unto you: Ye shall find a babe
wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger?"
</p>
<p>
And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host
praising God, and saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace, good will toward men."
</p>
<p>
And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into heaven,
the shepherds said one to another, "Let us now go even unto Bethlehem,
and see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known
to us."
</p>
<p>
And they came with haste, and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying
in the manger.
</p>
<p>
<i>Then</i> GRANDMOTHER <i>closes the Book</i>. And now your prayers,
<i>says she</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>They all kneel down for a few moments, the boys by the bed on the
right, the girls by the bed on the left. Then they rise and climb into
the beds.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>But</i> SALLY <i>has a question to ask</i>: May we sing one song,
Grandmother, before we go to sleep?
</p>
<p>
<i>And</i> GRANDMOTHER <i>answers</i>, Well, just one.
</p>
<p>
<i>Then sitting up in the bed, they sing the dear old song, that is
called</i>
</p>
<center>
THE CAROL OF CHRISTMAS NIGHT
</center>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Holy night! peaceful night! </p>
<p class="i2">   All is dark save the light </p>
<p class="i2">   Yonder where they sweet vigil keep </p>
<p class="i2">   O'er the Babe, who in silent sleep </p>
<p class="i2">   Rests in heavenly peace. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Silent night! holiest night! </p>
<p class="i2">   Darkness flies; all is light! </p>
<p class="i2">   Shepherds hear the angels sing, </p>
<p class="i2">   "Hallelujah! Hail the King! </p>
<p class="i2">   Christ, the Saviour, is here, </p>
<p class="i2">   Jesus, the Saviour, is here." </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
<i>When the song is finished, they all lie down. Grandmother tucks the
bed-clothes about their shoulders, and goes out. Soon they are all
asleep.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Then a faint sound of sleigh-bells is heard on the roof.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Then all is quiet for a moment.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>And THEN Santa Claus comes down the chimney, and steps out
into the room. Silently he looks at both beds, full of sleeping
children, turning his pocket flash light on them, so as to see them
better. He counts the children in each bed. Then he counts the stockings
hanging by the fire-place to be sure they are all there. Next he fills
each of the stockings, taking the toys out of his pack. Then he takes
his empty bag, and, after looking once more at the children, he
disappears up the Chimney.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>And this is the end of the Play</i>.

half-masks, long stockings.
</p>
<p>
THE SNOW FAIRIES&mdash;Four little girls, all in white, capes or coats,

<h2>
    Scenery And Scenic Effects
</h2>
<h3>
    SCENE I.
</h3>
<p>
The Chimney, which must be large enough to hold two people, one of them
Santa Claus with his pack of toys, may consist of a light frame covered
with turkey red cambric and backed with cardboard or heavy paper.
The cambric should be marked off into bricks. The face is produced by
cutting away the cardboard or paper backing behind two bricks for the
eyes, one for the nose and two together for the mouth. Boxes must cover
these openings on the inside, one for each eye and a larger one for
mouth and nose together. In these three boxes are three electric lights
which can be turned on and off independently by the boy inside the
chimney. Dry batteries have been used when an electric current was not
available. The light shining through the cambric makes the face. Turning
off, and on again, the light behind one of the eyes makes the chimney
wink, etc. Small hooks or nails, sticking out above the eyes, under the
nose, and under the mouth, should be provided to hold the snow which the
fairies hang on to represent eyebrows, mustache and beard.
</p>
<p>
The background and flies for this scene should be made of black cambric,
dull side out, and a dim light should be used, blue or green preferable,
so distributed as not to throw shadows on the "sky."
</p>
<p>
The trees may be real spruces or pines, or may be painted, or may be
made of green cambric touched up with paint or charcoal.
</p>
<p>
The wind noise is made by some one behind the scenes, preferably not the
Wind Fairies themselves. It should be plainly heard. The same applies to
the sound of water thrown on the fire.
</p>
<p>
If accompaniment is desired for the songs, a violin gives a better
effect than a piano.
</p>
<p>
The effect of falling snow is produced by a simple machine, consisting
of a connected series of perforated cardboard boxes suspended from a
cord or wire, and filled with finely cut paper. At one end they are
attached to a wire spring, and by a cord at the other end they are
shaken, so as to make the paper snow shower down. Such a machine may be
bought for a small sum from firms dealing in Sunday School supplies.
Two of them used together are more adequate than one.
</p>
<h3>
SCENE II.
</h3>
<p>
It is not necessary to use real beds. Boards on low horses or boxes
will make excellent substitutes, and a strip of cloth will conceal their
structure. An advantage of this plan is that they need not be as long
as regulation beds. Four children to a bed means packing them like
sardines, but it can be done, and it always amuses the audience.
</p>
<p>
The effect of a fire on the hearth can be made by quick motions
with an ever-ready flashlight operated from behind. The children and
Grandmother, standing in front, allow but an imperfect view of the
fire-place, so that the illusion is easy to produce. The fireplace,
however, may be a real one, if that is more convenient. In that case the
flashlight must be operated by one of the children, kneeling in front of
the fire-place; and when Santa Claus enters the room must be absolutely
dark, so that he will first be seen when he turns on his flashlight, as
he crouches before the fire-place, having apparently just come down the
chimney.
</p>
<p>
If candies or gifts are to be distributed to children in the audience,
as when this play is used as the Christmas entertainment of a Sunday
School, Mother Goose may come out again, as soon as the curtain closes
after the second scene, and speak as follows:
</p>
<p>
Well, my dear children, my little Play for you is finished, and I hope
you liked it. There is just one thing left to be said. Those little boys
and girls whom you saw asleep in their beds found that Santa Claus had
not only put into their stockings presents for THEM, but also left
something for YOU; and what do you suppose it was? A box of candy for
each one of you, and if you will sit still a moment longer, the curtain
will open again, and the candy will be handed to you. And so, my dears,
as I say Good-night, I wish you all (or I hope you have all had) a Merry
Christmas and (wish you) a Happy New Year.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
